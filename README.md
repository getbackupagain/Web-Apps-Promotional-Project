# Web-Apps-Promotional-Project
By Destry krepps

## Proposal

I am proposing a four part campaign for promoting our website. The first part is to get a small business page on Google, that way we will pop up when people search for farmers markets and local businesses in the area. The second part is to open up a social media page that links back to the platform. Social media will increase the reach we have and be a useful platform for engaging with customers. The third part is to optimize meta-data and content descriptions. Better meta-data and content descriptions will increase website relevance in regards to searches. The fourth part is to have regular blog posts. Blog posts can be shared on social media platforms, and notably create a broad variety of content for customers to find and interact with. Along with these four major steps, there are some smaller steps that should be looked into, such as search engine optimization, and mobile friendliness.
