## Proposal

I am proposing a four part campaign for promoting our website. The first part is to get a small business page on Google, that way we will pop up when people search for farmers markets and local businesses in the area. The second part is to open up a social media page that links back to the platform. Social media will increase the reach we have and be a useful platform for engaging with customers. The third part is to optimize meta-data and content descriptions. Better meta-data and content descriptions will increase website relevance in regards to searches. The fourth part is to have regular blog posts. Blog posts can be shared on social media platforms, and notably create a broad variety of content for customers to find and interact with. Along with these four major steps, there are some smaller steps that should be looked into, such as search engine optimization, and mobile friendliness.  

## Google Small Business Page

Opening a Google small business page represents the easiest way to promote the website. The only way a user would find our website is either by passing by our storefront, or from word of mouth. By opening up a google small business page and tying it to google maps, we take advantage of being visible as a local business. Without a small business page the only way a person would find the website is if they knew the name of the location in advance, which is a bad way to gain new customers. With a small business page, our store would pop up more readily when a person searches for "local restaurants" or "farm stand" or "local small business" making it more likely to gain new site viewers. The process is relatively simple, one just has to set up a google account with a business email domain and open a business profile. From there, we can fill out the locations we serve, and contact info, and most importantly the website. The process is free, and relatively straight forward. It would probably behoov us to add some pictures to increase brand visibility and awareness.

## Social Media Platform/Campaign 

A social media campaign is another good way to expand our reach and brand awareness. Customers that already know of us can follow the store on social media, that way they can be made aware of new products and ongoing promotions. The reason for this is twofold, as they are made aware of new products and promotions, they can also share that information with their friend base. As they share that information with their friend base, more people become aware of us, and the reach of our brand improves. The second reason is that reliable posts from the business reinforces the customer's awareness of our brand, and increases positive feelings associated with it (if done correctly). Given the turmoil associated with the platform right now, this is perhaps not an optimal time to start a twitter campaign. However, facebook would probably be a good platform to work with. The demographic of facebook overlaps pretty well with our expected customer base. At the base of the social media campaign, we should start a page. This is considered a better option for business than having a normal facebook profile. For one thing "Pages are listed more prominently on people’s profiles. That is, your page’s logo will appear in your fans’ profiles, not just the name, as with a group. That’s cool, because one of the biggest ways that you attract fans is when people browse their friends’ profiles. If they see that their friend is a fan of your page, they may also sign up" (Holzner ch3) which is better for visibility. After that there should be a plan
