## Proposal

I am proposing a four part campaign for promoting our website. The first part is to get a small business page on Google, that way we will pop up when people search for farmers markets and local businesses in the area. The second part is to open up a social media page that links back to the platform. Social media will increase the reach we have and be a useful platform for engaging with customers. The third part is to optimize meta-data and content descriptions. Better meta-data and content descriptions will increase website relevance in regards to searches. The fourth part is to have regular blog posts. Blog posts can be shared on social media platforms, and notably create a broad variety of content for customers to find and interact with. Along with these four major steps, there are some smaller steps that should be looked into, such as search engine optimization, and mobile friendliness.  

## Google Small Business Page

Opening a Google small business page represents the easiest way to promote the website. The only way a user would find our website is either by passing by our storefront, or from word of mouth. By opening up a google small business page and tying it to google maps, we take advantage of being visible as a local business. Without a small business page the only way a person would find the website is if they knew the name of the location in advance, which is a bad way to gain new customers. With a small business page, our store would pop up more readily when a person searches for "local restaurants" or "farm stand" or "local small business" making it more likely to gain new site viewers. The process is relatively simple, one just has to set up a google account with a business email domain and open a business profile. From there, we can fill out the locations we serve, and contact info, and most importantly the website. The process is free, and relatively straight forward. It would probably behoov us to add some pictures to increase brand visibility and awareness.
