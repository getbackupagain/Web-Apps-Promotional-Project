# Web-Apps-Promotional-Project
By Destry krepps

## Proposal

  I am proposing a four part campaign for promoting our website. The first part is to get a small business page on Google, that way we will pop up when people search for farmers markets and local businesses in the area. The second part is to open up a social media page that links back to the platform. Social media will increase the reach we have and be a useful platform for engaging with customers. The third part is to optimize meta-data and content descriptions. Better meta-data and content descriptions will increase website relevance in regards to searches. The fourth part is to have regular blog posts. Blog posts can be shared on social media platforms, and notably create a broad variety of content for customers to find and interact with. Along with these four major steps, there are some smaller steps that should be looked into, such as search engine optimization, and mobile friendliness.  

## Google Small Business Page

  Opening a Google small business page represents the easiest way to promote the website. The only way a user would find our website is either by passing by our storefront, or from word of mouth. By opening up a google small business page and tying it to google maps, we take advantage of being visible as a local business. Without a small business page the only way a person would find the website is if they knew the name of the location in advance, which is a bad way to gain new customers. With a small business page, our store would pop up more readily when a person searches for "local restaurants" or "farm stand" or "local small business" making it more likely to gain new site viewers. The process is relatively simple, one just has to set up a google account with a business email domain and open a business profile. From there, we can fill out the locations we serve, and contact info, and most importantly the website. The process is free, and relatively straight forward. It would probably behoov us to add some pictures to increase brand visibility and awareness.

## Social Media Platform/Campaign 

  A social media campaign is another good way to expand our reach and brand awareness. Customers that already know of us can follow the store on social media, that way they can be made aware of new products and ongoing promotions. The reason for this is twofold, as they are made aware of new products and promotions, they can also share that information with their friend base. As they share that information with their friend base, more people become aware of us, and the reach of our brand improves. The second reason is that reliable posts from the business reinforces the customer's awareness of our brand, and increases positive feelings associated with it (if done correctly). Given the turmoil associated with the platform right now, this is perhaps not an optimal time to start a twitter campaign. However, facebook would probably be a good platform to work with. The demographic of facebook overlaps pretty well with our expected customer base. At the base of the social media campaign, we should start a page. This is considered a better option for business than having a normal facebook profile. For one thing "Pages are listed more prominently on people’s profiles. That is, your page’s logo will appear in your fans’ profiles, not just the name, as with a group. That’s cool, because one of the biggest ways that you attract fans is when people browse their friends’ profiles. If they see that their friend is a fan of your page, they may also sign up" (Holzner ch3) which is better for visibility. After that there should be a plan to make reliable and frequent posts about ongoing promotions and new products. This would most likely eventually involve a dedicated social media manager at some point.


## Meta-Data Optimization

  This point is probably the least important since "Meta keywords were devalued by Google because they were being abused by site owners and marketers" ("Meta Keywords") but it is still worth getting right. While google has devalued them, that doesn't mean they aren't factored in, and that doesn't mean the other search platforms don't use them. I would advise using something like:

```

<meta name="keywords" content="produce, baked goods, farm, organic">

```

  The actual content can vary a little bit, and I would say some time should be taken to come up with a list of 10 items, but not more than that. Potentially, misspellings should be included as well if they are common enough.


## Regular Blog Posts

  When most people think of promotional campaigns, they think of sales or special events. I would argue that while those can have significant returns, they are high risk reward strategies. You could burn a lot of marketing money on a sale that is ultimately not enticing to customers, or worse you significantly underestimate the customer's ability to game the system and you end up losing money even if you gain more sales. A better strategy is to increase the public's awareness of you and your product, and a great way to do that is blog posting. While it doesn't sound that important "For most users, blogs play a not-insignificant role in purchasing decisions. If you’re doing online marketing and you’re not writing a blog, you’d better have a pretty good reason why not" (Zarella ch 7) because it is a relatively low risk option with high reward. The main cost is the time, and the labor to make a post, but once made, blog posts stick around for a while. They can get shared around on social media which synergizes well with my second point. They also increase content on the website which gives bots more information to index and hopefully give a higher search ranking.

## Other Things

  These aren't directly related to marketing, but they still tie in to customer experience, brand image, and awareness.

  Obviously, the website should work, and run smoothly on all platforms. A poorly functioning or slow website will turn customers away.

  Our links should be written such that google webcrawlers can access them properly. There's a lot of information on Google Search Central https://developers.google.com/search about optimizing a website in such a way so that it has a better search ranking.

  I alluded to this before, but eventually it would be advantageous to hire someone to be in charge of social media and blog posts, perhaps multiple people eventually. To start with, splitting the responsibility between the current team would be acceptible. However that is not a sustainable strategy for reliable community interaction and engagement. 


## Conclusions

  A promotional campaign is a difficult thing to pull of, especially when first starting out. One is flying relatively blind and lacks the experience of time. For this reason, I have prioritized lower risk options that give a stable foundation to build on. Eventually, a radical sales campaign might be the best option, but that won't succeed without a broad audience. Through social media, and regular blog content, one can build an audience to reach, and a platform to reach them with, so as not to be speaking into a relatively empty void. In turn, a small business page, and meta keywords provide a reliable method of converting unfamiliar searchers into curious customers, and eventually a loyal support base. A loyal support base is foundational to any successful brand.
